# Uiki: A simple academic wiki

Uiki (wee-kee) is a simple academic wiki which supports:

  + [MathJax] for LaTeX formatting
  + [multimarkdown] for markdown formatting
  + git for page versioning/offline editing
  + [prettify] for syntax highlighting
  + `htpasswd`-style files for user authentication
  + SSL-encrypted connections

To enable remote checkouts/editing and to avoid the 
risk of losing data due to upgrades, all uiki pages are stored 
in (markdown-formatted) plaintext.

For a page `<name>`, the content for that page will be (by default) in:

    db/<name>/content.md

which is also easily editable by a text editor on the server.

This program serves as the motivation for my article on 
[web programming in Racket](http://matt.might.net/articles/low-level-web-in-racket/).


## Dependencies

 + racket
 + git
 + multimarkdown
 + sed
 + htpasswd (bundled with Apache)
 + openssl (if generating a key and cert)


## Installation

There is no installation.  Uiki runs in place.


## Running

To run uiki, use:

    make run

or directly with:

    racket uiki.rkt

By default, it will be on port 8080, and the main page is `/wiki/main`.

After you start it, set your browser to:

    http://localhost:8080/wiki/main



## Configuration

Configuration parameters are in `config.rkt`.

By default, authentication is on, but SSL is off.

To generate `config.rkt`, run `make config.rkt`.

The first time the server runs, it will create a `passwd`
file and ask you to create an `admin` account.



## Adding users

You can add users with `htpasswd` by modifying `passwd`,
but users must use SHA1-hashed passwords.

For example, in the application directory:

    htpasswd -s passwd john



## Enabling SSL

Run `make certs` to generate a private key and a self-signed 
certificate in the directory `certs`.

Then, modify the approriate entries in `global.rkt` to point 
to these, and set `use-ssl?` to `#t`.



## Wiki syntax

You can link to new pages by enclosing their name in `[[` and `]]`.

You can use the pipe `[[target|text]]` notation to redirect a 
within-wiki link.


## Markdown syntax

Markdown syntax is supported by [multimarkdown].


## LaTeX syntax

Inline LaTeX syntax is supported with `$`-notation, as in `$f(x)$`.

Equation blocks are supported by surrounding LaTeX with `\\[` and `\\]`,
as in:

```
\\[
 Z = \int_0^\infty g(x)d(x)
\\]
```


## Syntax highlighting

You can render code with syntax highlighting in 
a fenced block by specifying the language, as in:

    ```javascript
    function main () {
       printf("Running some code.")
    }
    ```
